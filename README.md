# intertoys_storefront

## Synopsis
We picked the Intertoys from the city center of Hengelo (Overijssel) as our storefront inspiration and took our own photograph of the facade. In our design, we subsequently included the second floor of the building, the actual storefront and most of the branding on it, including the words above the storefront and the general placement of windows; both of the toy store but also of the housing unit above.
